# Conda-forge (NunFOCUS)
My goal creating this page is to:
1. Have different point of views of the structure of conda-forge;
2. Try to understand more about some fundamental concepts of the conda-forge auto-tick bot;
3. Know everyone better (if possible);
4. Share my current development into the issues and processes i am engaged;
5. Get more experience with the community to help even more.

My main questions will be stored in the issues section of this page, until i discover how to put a blog-answer style here.
Also, there will be my current state in the problem i am involved.

Current issue (engaged): [#842][i842]

If there is something you would like to comment or help me with, i will gratefully accept (you can comment here - issues) or send me a message on Gitter.
