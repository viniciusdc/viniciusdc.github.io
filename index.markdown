title: Main Goals

My goal creating this page is to:
1. Have different point of views of the structure of conda-forge;
2. Try to understand more about some fundamental concepts of the conda-forge auto-tick bot;
3. Know everyone better (if possible);
4. Share my current development into the issues and processes I am engaged;
5. Get more experience with the community to help even more.

Currently waiting for the last evaluation of the GSoC project, and working on the Profiler extra [issue](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/1131).

If there is something you would like to comment or help me with, I will gratefully accept (you can comment here - issues) or send me a message on Gitter.
