As already mentioned i will work (and learn) with the issue regro/cf-scripts#842, as citeded by  https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/issues/842#issuecomment-599764576
just to begin with:

1. Read the graph (clone cf-graph-county-fair, use --depth=1, cd to that dir)
2. Load it (call gx = load_graph(), see the main function)
3. call the update versions function in main
4. Inside the update versions function, write the potentially new version for each package to some json in a dir

Until now i have the following code, that summarize the instructions:
```python
from conda_forge_tick.utils import load_graph
import json

gx = load_graph()

# from here you can inspect the graph object
print("# of nodes:", len(gx.nodes))
data = {}
data["packid_version"] = []
for pack_id in gx.nodes:
    with gx.nodes["{}".format(pack_id)]["payload"] as attrs:
        data["packid_version"].append({
            "id": str(pack_id),
            "version": str(attrs.get("version"))
        })

with open("new_version.json", 'w') as outfile:
    json.dump(data, outfile)
```

As already discussed, our goal is to write the new versions to a separate data structure outside of the graph. So, for the next step i will adapt the code above using the function `get_latest_version` in a new arrangement inside the loop.

Actual status, created a PR in `cf-scripts` for the new `load_graph` function.
