  This report will be a little bit longer than normal cause it will comprehend all the week changes too. So let's start.
  
1. Status : There was three big features that I've been doing during the last two weeks. First one, I've changed a little how the new information is inserted at `make_graph` function as we already had an `.update` method for `LaizyJSON` files. During the last week we could test how the new working environment for the `new_update_upstream_version` is doing, also if the information regarding the `JSON` files stored at `versions` folder is being correctly loaded and inserted at your `graph`. The second one, I also found a test script for the update functions called `test_update_upstream_versions` at a test folder on `cf-scripts` repo, this served as a good way to test if the new alterations with the `.update` method were working well. The third big feature, occurred during the Scipy 2020 wich I had the great opportunity to participate, with excellent presentations and very interesting discussions as also a session of discussion with two of my mentors about `conda-forge` and the packaging systems.
