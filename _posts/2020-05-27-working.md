  1. Status:: New commits regarding the updates on `update_versions` functiona and some research about `logging` and `networkx` packages. I also create an repository called `ts-graph` to test directly the function using `Circle CI` (what comes to be an excellent tool, it awesome!). This updates can be found here [#Cm] as also the research will be available soon on another post;

  2. Abstract:: The big new implementations on `update function` aims its communication with the bot structure (following the old one). Basically there are two new updates:
      1. Separated the packages `sources` from the main script, as corrected the missing packages for this migration;
      1. The other change, was the action of a `main` function that call your update process:
    
```python
def main(args: Any = None) -> None:
      logger.info("cft :: conda_forge_tick")
      if CONDA_FORGE_TICK_DEBUG:
        setup_logger(logger, level="debug")
      else:
        setup_logger(logger)
        
      logger.info("Reading graph")
      # Graph enabled for inspection
      gx = load_graph()
      
      # call update
      to_update = new_update_upstream_versions(gx)
      
      logger.info("writing out file")
      with open("new_version.json", "w") as outfile:
        json.dump(to_update, outfile)
if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```
   Here we can see some new features, a DEBUG option for `logger`, the `load_graph` function now has its own place together with the `JSON` expected output.

   This Tuesday we had a new meeting regarding this last updated and the postpone of DynamoDB migration (at least for this process). I will commit some others minor alteration and wait for validation. Localy it's working fine, so some tests will be made remotely together with our main bot porcess.

 3. Next Steps:: If everythong goes well on the remote fase test, I will try to upgrade the output structure to be a little more organic and easier to manipulate. And try to figure out some solutions for errors like this:
 ```python
 Warning: Error getting upstream version of ostaphep: InvalidVersionSpec: Invalid version '1.4.8%2C6': invalid character(s)
 Warning: Error getting upstream version of pyflame: AttributeError("'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'")
 ```
