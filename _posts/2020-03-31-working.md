As already mentioned i will work (and learn) with the issue regro/cf-scripts#842, as citeded by [Matthew](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/issues/842#issuecomment-599764576)
just to begin with:

1. Read the graph (clone cf-graph-county-fair, use --depth=1, cd to that dir)
2. Load it (call gx = load_graph(), see the main function)
3. call the update versions function in main
4. Inside the update versions function, write the potentially new version for each package to some json in a dir

Until now i have the following code, that summarize the instructions:
```python
from conda_forge_tick.utils import load_graph
from conda_forge_tick.update_upstream_versions import (
    get_latest_version,
    PyPI,
    CRAN,
    NPM,
    ROSDistro,
    RawURL,
    Github,
)
import random
import json

sources = (PyPI(), CRAN(), NPM(), ROSDistro(), RawURL(), Github())

print("Reading graph")
gx = load_graph()
_all_nodes = [t for t in gx.nodes.items()]
random.shuffle(_all_nodes)

# from here you can inspect the graph object, and what node will be updated:
print(f"Number of nodes: {len(gx.nodes)}")
Node_count = 0

to_update = {}
to_update["nodes"] = []
for node, node_attrs in _all_nodes:
    with node_attrs["payload"] as attrs:
        # verify the actual situation of the package;
        actual_ver = str(attrs.get("version"))
        if attrs.get("bad") or attrs.get("archived"):
            print(
                f"# {Node_count:<5} - {node:<30} - ver: {actual_ver:<10} - bad/archived"
            )
            continue
        # new version request
        try:
            new_version = get_latest_version(node, attrs, sources)
        except Exception as e:
            try:
                se = repr(e)
            except Exception as ee:
                se = "Bad exception string: {}".format(ee)
                print(f"Warning: Error getting upstream version of {node}: {se}")
        else:
            print(
                f"# {Node_count:<5} - {node:<30} - ver: {attrs.get('version'):<10} - new ver: {new_version}"
            )

        to_update["nodes"].append({"id": str(node), "version": str(new_version)})
    Node_count += 1

print("writing out file")
with open("new_version.json", "w") as outfile:
    json.dump(to_update, outfile)
```

As already discussed, our goal is to write the new versions to a separate data structure, now using Dynamodb, outside of the graph.  So, for the next step i will adapt the code output using the table structure, or similar, for Dynamodb.

Actual status, created a PR in `cf-scripts` for the new `migrate_update_version.py`. As an update, I Am learning more about the key concepts involving Dynamodb from here: https://www.dynamodbguide.com
