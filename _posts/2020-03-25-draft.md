## Google Summer of Code 2020 improved automatic maintenance of `conda-forge`

# Abstract

Conda-forge, an umbrella project of NumFOCUS, is a community effort that provides conda packages for a wide range of software. As an important part of its structure the conda forge "auto-tick" bot enables automatic maintenance of conda-forge packages.   By that, my project during the google summer of code will be the improvement of the bot structure, more specifically, separating the version updates structure to its own microservice, creating a more organic environment for the bot, and possibly, in  future, helping with a more efficient migrations of its files.

# Technical Details
Long description of the project. Must include all technical details of the projects like libraries involved.
Here it is important to show if you had previous conversations with your mentors. You can show relevant pieces of code that you want to change. You can link to literature you used during the research.

# Schedule of Deliverables
Here should come a list of your milestones. This list is a start based on the difference phases of GSoC. Use it as a start. You can/should add more details for each phase by breaking it down into weeks or set specific targets for each phase. Each target should be split into sub task with a time estimate, work breakdown structures are helpful here.

# Community Bonding Period
This phase is to get to know the community better. Check that your build environment is setup. This time should also be used to discuss your project in more detail with the community and in general introduce it.
Note: We require you to write regular blog posts. Now is a good time to make sure your blog works and send us the link.

# Phase 1
Deliverables

# Phase 2
Deliverables

# Final Week
At this stage you should finish up your project. At this stage you should make sure that you have code submitted to your organization. Our criteria to mark your project as a success is to submit code before the end of GSoC.

# Development Experience
Do you have code on github? Can you show previous contributions to other projects? Did you do other code related projects or university courses?
