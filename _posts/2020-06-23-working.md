 Let's start.
 
 1. Status :: Waiting for merge the new updates and bug removal for `new_update_upstream_version` (see [p1049]). Also working on the old issues [i200] and [i321] of conda-forge auto-tick-bot.
 2. Abstract ::During the week we had some problems relating the dump.json process of [p1027] and some unused statements that was solved by a bug PR update [p1049], we can see at this [CircleCi](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/regro/circle_worker/10388/workflows/b65e927d-dd27-4f7f-a505-269d16202db3/jobs/26564) test. As the `sequential` form of the `update_upstream_version` took so much time to complete the respective jobs started to stack at our CircleCi workflow. Them as the new `version` folder was successfully deployed at `cf-graph-countyfair` we stopped the run usage of the new code to merge the `pool` version, as explained at the last weak post. Now we have to wait to merge the new alterations I started to work on some old issues of `cf-scripts` as [i200][i321]. One of them uses some alterations at our migration phase, so during the next week meeting I will ask of some revisions, merge the alterations and talk about the migrations and the issues solve ideas.
 3. Next Steps ::Wait for merged alteration and discuss about the [i200], [i321] issues.
