  [Conda-forge](https://numfocus.org/project/conda-forge), an umbrella project of [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/), is a [community](https://gitter.im/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io) effort that provides conda packages for a wide range of software, building and distributing packages, specialized in the hard-to-build or unique packages that often arise in a scientific computing context. 

  The conda-forge ecosystem is fully structured around automation, the "auto-tick" bot plays an important role in the automatic maintenance of conda-forge packages, allowing the maintainers to build packages for different systems architectures, as also keeping their packages up-to-date automatically, and ensuring a high level of quality.
