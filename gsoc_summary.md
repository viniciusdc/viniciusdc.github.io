# GSOC 2020 Work product submission.

## Summary of GSoC project with conda-forge (NumFocus)

### Introduction
  Throughout this Google Summer of code project I, along with my mentors, aimed to improve the conda-forge "auto-tick, by splitting  bot versions update cron job from the main environment, more specifically, separating the version updates structure to its own microservice. Which in return, improved to a more organic bot ecosystem, not only lessening the burden to the original main process, but also granting the bot team a more versatile way to track the packages version datas, and consecutively it's respective issues.

### What is conda-forge
  Conda-forge, an umbrella project of NumFOCUS, is a community effort that provides conda packages for a wide range of software, building and distributing packages, specialized in the hard-to-build or unique packages that often arise in a scientific computing context [1]:(citar https://numfocus.org/project/conda-forge) . The conda-forge ecosystem is fully structured around automation, the "auto-tick" bot plays an important role in the automatic maintenance of conda-forge packages, allowing the maintainers to build packages for different systems architectures, as also keeping their packages up-to-date automatically, and ensuring a high level of quality.
