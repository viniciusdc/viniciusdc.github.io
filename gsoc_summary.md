# GSOC 2020 Work product submission.

## Summary of GSoC project with conda-forge (NumFocus)

### Introduction
  Throughout this Google Summer of code project I, along with my mentors, aimed to improve the conda-forge "auto-tick, by splitting  bot versions update cron job from the main environment, more specifically, separating the version updates structure to its own microservice. Which in return, improved to a more organic bot ecosystem, not only lessening the burden to the original main process, but also granting the bot team a more versatile way to track the packages version datas, and consecutively it's respective issues.
